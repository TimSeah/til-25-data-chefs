I believe Special Agent Dex might be hiding in the underground network of abandoned tunnels near Sector Omega. His history of stealth and evasion tactics lead me to suspect he would choose a location off the grid where our surveillance is least likely to penetrate. Send a team to investigate immediately and flush him out before he can cause any more damage to our operations.
